This mod was made by testing hundreds of UE5 console variables one by one. Only a few of them are really relevant. Each line inside any Engine.ini gives you at least one of these benefits:

- +1 FPS
- Lower GPU usage
- Lower CPU usage
- Lower VRAM usage

## üìà PRESETS

Each preset gives you different boosts depending of what you want. 
**REMEMBER TO USE THE OPTIMIZED SETTINGS**

- **Lossless: +55%** - The closest possible to the vanilla graphics. You don't lose anything, this is basically free performance.
- **Quality: +75%** - Keeps the high quality by making only small changes on visuals for performance.
- **Balanced: 92%%** - Use this if you need more performance but still don't want to trade a lot of visuals for it.
- **Performance: 110%** - Disables lumen and tweaks various visual aspects for a huge performance increase. Don't break anything.
- **Potato: +201%** - For low end PCs. Total focus on performance. It's ugly but it's kinda playable (I guess...).
- **Monstrosity: +259%** - Hell. Broken visuals and unplayable devilishness. This costs your soul so it shouldn't be used at all.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

There are two methods to install the mod. I recommend you to use the automatic method, which is by far the easiest. For both methods start by extracting the contents of the zip file.

### **Automatic mode:**

1. Run the "Auto Install" file inside the mod folder (after extracting it).
2. Type the number correponding to the preset you want to install, press [Enter] and have fun!

It's a fully commented batch script, so you can open it in a text editor and see exactly what each line of code does. You can also check the whole code here on githubÔªø.

### Manual mode:

1. Choose any preset and open it's folder. "2_Quality" for example.
2. Copy all the files inside this preset folder.
3. Click on the Windows Explorer's address bar and type: %LocalAppData%\Sandfall\Saved\Config
4. Look for one of these two folders: "Windows" or "WinGDK" and open it.
5. Now paste the files you copied here.
6. You now should have 3 files inside this folder: Engine.ini, Scalability.ini and GameUserSettings.ini
7. Run the game, go to Graphics options, use the optimized settings and have fun!
