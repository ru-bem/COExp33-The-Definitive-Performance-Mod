This mod was made by testing hundreds of UE5 console variables one by one. Only a few of them are really relevant. Each line inside any Engine.ini gives you at least one of these benefits:

- +1 FPS
- Lower GPU usage
- Lower CPU usage
- Lower VRAM usage

---

## üìà PRESETS

Each preset gives you different boosts depending of what you want. 
**REMEMBER TO USE THE OPTIMIZED SETTINGS**

- **Lossless: +45%** - Total focus on visuals. The closest possible to the vanilla graphics.
- **Quality: +60%** - Keeps the high quality making some small trades for performance
- **Performance: +95%** - Extract the most performance possible without breaking the visuals.
- **Potato: +175%** - For Low End PCs, total focus on performance. Ugly but not broken.
- **Monstrosity: +225%** - Hell. Broken visuals and unplayable devilishness. This is the lightest this game can ever be. Shouldn't be used at all.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

There are two methods to install the mod. I recommend you to use the automatic method, which is by far the easiest. For both methods start by extracting the contents of the zip file.

### **Automatic mode:**

1. Run the "Automatic Install" file inside the mod folder (after extracting it).
2. Type the number correponding to the preset you want to install, press [Enter] and have fun!

It's a fully commented batch script, so you can open it in a text editor and see exactly what each line of code does. You can also check the whole code here on githubÔªø.

### Manual mode:

1. Choose any preset and open it's folder. "2_Quality" for example.
2. Copy the file inside this preset folder (Engine.ini).
3. Click on the Windows Explorer's address bar and type: %LocalAppData%\Sandfall\Saved\Config
4. Look for one of these two folders: "Windows" or "WinGDK" and open it.
5. Now paste the "Engine.ini" you copied here.
6. You now should have 2 files inside this folder: Engine.ini and GameUserSettings.ini
7. Run the game, go to Graphics options and use the optimized settings and have fun!
