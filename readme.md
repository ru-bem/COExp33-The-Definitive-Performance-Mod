This mod was made by testing hundreds of UE5 console variables one by one. Only a few of them are really relevant. Each line inside any Engine.ini gives you at least one of these benefits:

- +1 FPS
- Lower GPU usage
- Lower CPU usage
- Lower VRAM usage

## üìà PRESETS

Each preset gives you different boosts depending of what you want. 
**REMEMBER TO USE THE OPTIMIZED SETTINGS**

- **üü∞ Lossless: +70%** - The closest possible to the original. This is basically free performance and better graphics.
- **‚ö™ Quality: +80%** - Very high quality. Only small visual changes were made for performance.
- **‚öñÔ∏è Balanced: 105%%** - Same as quality but with little less quality lumen and shadows (basically).
- **‚è© Performance: 127%** - A miracle. No lumen but you won't even notice. Huge performance increase.
- **ü•î Potato: +201%** - For low end PCs. Total focus on performance. Ugly but playable.
- **üíÄ Monstrosity: +261%** - Hell. Broken visuals and unplayable devilishness. This costs your soul and shouldn't be used at all.
- [NEW!] Steam Deck - Optimized for Steam Deck. [BETA]

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

There are two methods to install the mod. I recommend you to use the automatic method, which is by far the easiest. For both methods start by extracting the contents of the zip file.

### **Automatic mode:**

1. Run the "Auto Install" file inside the mod folder (after extracting it).
2. Type the number correponding to the preset you want to install, press [Enter] and have fun!

It's a fully commented batch script, so you can open it in a text editor and see exactly what each line of code does. You can also check the whole code here on githubÔªø.

### Manual mode:

1. Choose any preset and open it's folder. "2_Quality" for example.
2. Copy all the files inside this preset folder.
3. Click on the Windows Explorer's address bar and type: %LocalAppData%\Sandfall\Saved\Config
4. Look for one of these two folders: "Windows" or "WinGDK" and open it.
5. Now paste the files you copied here.
6. You now should have 3 files inside this folder: Engine.ini, Scalability.ini and GameUserSettings.ini
7. Run the game, go to Graphics options, use the optimized settings and have fun!
