## ℹ️ The Definitive Performance Mod
### Overbright Manor

The devs made the game with Lumen as the main lighting method.
Yes, they programmed a fallback lighting method for some areas, but they forgot The Manor and some other specific areas.
This means that when Lumen is disabled, the lighting in those areas will look bad.

Lumen is disabled in the **Performance INI** and **Potato INI** in my mod, so people can expect this to happen.
I couldn't find a way to make the lighting inside The Manor look good without Lumen without breaking the lighting in every other part of the game.

If anyone reading this comment can help me find a way to fix this, send me a message anywhere.
